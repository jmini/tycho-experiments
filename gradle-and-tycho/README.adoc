= Gradle and Tycho

This experiment is about consuming in a Maven Tycho build some bundles produced by Gradle.

The goal is to obtain an update site containing a feature to be able to install the plugin into an existing Eclipse installation.

== The eclipse plugins

Two Eclipse plugins are built using gradle:

* `fr.jmini.eclipse.core`: a plugin to hold business logic (no UI code)
* `fr.jmini.eclipse.ui`: a plugin that makes a contribution to the UI and that requires the core one.

The projects were created with Eclipse Wizard "New Project" > "Plugin project". For the UI plugin the template "Hello, World Command" was used.

The plugin adds a simple command that opens a message box.

The message inside the message box is defined in the `fr.jmini.eclipse.core` plugin (in a real project those plugins should contains real business logic).

== Technical setup

Gradle is used to build the two plugins (`fr.jmini.eclipse.core` and `fr.jmini.eclipse.ui`).
The command `./gradlew publish` will publish them in a local maven repository located under `build/repo/` at the root of the `gradle-and-tycho` project.

The maven tycho build is configured using the link:https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/How_Tos/Dependency_on_pom-first_artifacts[the `<pomDependencies>consider</pomDependencies>` feature] to pick up the jars published by gradle in the first step.

Then it builds following two modules:

* `feature.fr.jmini.eclipse`
* `updatesite.fr.jmini.eclipse`

Tycho can be executed with `mvn package`.
It requires Java 11 to run (prerequisite for tycho `2.x.x`).

The result of the build is an update-site folder located here: `updatesite.fr.jmini.eclipse/target/site/`.
